# Colors

The SCSS for this component contains additional modifying classes to change the accent colors for the element to one of the colors from the ASU palette. All supported accent colors can be triggered with the modifying class `.accent-` + the color.

The following example will change the color of the SVG quote image as well as the separator between the quoted text and the citations on mobile.

```
<figure class="uds-blockquote accent-gold">
  <img src="your-image.jpg" alt="Image description" />
  <blockqoute> ... </blockquote>
  <figcaption> ... </figcaption>
</figure>
```

The following table outlines the included accent colors as well as supported background colors on which they can appear.

| Accent color class | Possible background colors    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| default (gray-7)   | white, gray-1 through gray-4  |
| .accent-gold       | white, gray-1, gray-2, gray-7 |
| .accent-maroon     | white, gray-1, gray-2, gray-7 |
| .accent-white      | gray-5 through gray-7         |
| .accent-gray-5     | gray-1, gray-2, gray-7        |

The markup for including a background color is present in one of the stories within Storybook, but can be acheived in multiple ways depending on your application.

- The recommended padding for the wrapping element for the `<figure class="uds-blockquote">` is 2rem.
- UDS-Bootstrap utility classes can also be helpful here. Try: `<div class="wrapper p-4 bg-gray-7">...</div>`

# The open quote svg

The SVG image that is included in the markup for this element has been optimized for proper accessibility using the pattern typically produced by Font Awesome. It is included as a direct SVG element (as opposed to an image file) so that the color can be manipulated by the SASS files.

```
<svg title="Open quote" role="img" aria-labelledby="open-quote-title" viewBox="0 0 302.87 245.82">
  <title id="open-quote-title">Open quote</title>
  <path d="M113.61,245.82H0V164.56q0-49.34,8.69-77.83T40.84,35.58Q64.29,12.95,100.67,0l22.24,46.9q-34,11.33-48.72,31.54T58.63,132.21h55Zm180,0H180V164.56q0-49.74,8.7-78T221,35.58Q244.65,12.95,280.63,0l22.24,46.9q-34,11.33-48.72,31.54t-15.57,53.77h55Z"/>
</svg>
```

By applying inline styles to the `<svg>` element itself, you can modify the color as needed. Use the CSS `fill:` property.

```
<!-- ASU Blue quote -->
<svg style="fill:#00A3E0;" viewBox="0 0 302.87 245.82"> ... </svg>
```

The SVG glyph is the opening double quote glyph from within **Arial Bold**. See the [following page](https://practicaltypography.com/straight-and-curly-quotes.html) for details about alternate ways to produce that glyph.
