# Blockquote, Basic Options

The recommended markup for a blockquote begins from the following pattern.

```
<div class="uds-blockquote">
  <svg title="Open quote" role="presentation" viewBox="0 0 302.87 245.82">
    <path d="M113.61,245.82H0V164.56q0-49.34,8.69-77.83T40.84,35.58Q64.29,12.95,100.67,0l22.24,46.9q-34,11.33-48.72,31.54T58.63,132.21h55Zm180,0H180V164.56q0-49.74,8.7-78T221,35.58Q244.65,12.95,280.63,0l22.24,46.9q-34,11.33-48.72,31.54t-15.57,53.77h55Z"/>
  </svg>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</p>
    <div class="citation">
      <cite class="name">Thomas Jefferson</cite>
      <cite class="description">The Declaration of Independence</cite>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
</div>
```

The SCSS for the blockquote also provide for several modifier classes for the `.uds-blockquote` class in order to facilitate some of the key design elements. Specifically, by adding modifier classes you can:

- Include a different accent color for both the pull quote and the horizontal rule on mobile.
- Change the presentation from a "fancy quote" to an image.
- Reverse the layout of the quote w/image to place the image on the right.

## Accent colors

The SCSS for this component contains additional modifying classes to change the accent colors for the element to one of the colors from the ASU palette. All supported accent colors can be triggered with the modifying class `.accent-` + the color.

The following example will change the color of the SVG quote image as well as the separator between the quoted text and the citations on mobile.

```
<div class="uds-blockquote accent-maroon">
  <svg title="Open quote" role="presentation" viewBox="0 0 302.87 245.82">...</svg>
  <blockquote>
    ...
  </blockquote>
</div>
```

The following table outlines the included accent colors as well as supported background colors on which they can appear. Be sure to wrap this declaration in a media query to prevent it from showing up on the desktop presentation.

| Accent color class | Possible background colors    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| default (gray-7)   | white, gray-1 through gray-4  |
| .accent-gold       | white, gray-1, gray-2, gray-7 |
| .accent-maroon     | white, gray-1, gray-2, gray-7 |
| .accent-white      | gray-5 through gray-7         |
| .accent-gray-5     | gray-1, gray-2, gray-7        |

## Blockquote with image

Modifying the initial `.uds-blockquote` element to include the class `.with-image` modifies the initial CSS grid for the desktop viewport to produce the correct padding for all of the other elements.

Replace the `<svg>` markup with markup for a standard image and leave it in its current source order for best results. (Don't forget the `alt` text!)

```
<div class="uds-blockquote with-image">
  <img src="https://placeimg.com/400/400/any" alt="Must include alt text"/>
  <blockquote>
    ...
  </blockquote>
</div>
```

## Blockquote with image, reverse layout

Adding both the `.with-image` and `.reversed` classes to the initial `.uds-blockquote` element will reverse the initial layout of the quote and image. The image will be aligned to the right of the quote.

Including the `.reversed` class without the additional modifying `.with-image` class will have no effect.

```
<div class="uds-blockquote with-image reversed">
  <img src="https://placeimg.com/400/400/any" alt="Must include alt text"/>
  <blockquote>
    ...
  </blockquote>
</div>
```
