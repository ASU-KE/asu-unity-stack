- Similar to other quick start templates:
`create-react-app`

- Development server uses a custom host, which needs to be added to your machines host file `127.0.0.1 localhost.unity.web.asu.edu`
  - Mac file location `/etc/hosts`
  - Windows file location `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`

- Development site can be viewed https://localhost.asu.edu:4200/
- While developing, only pages within this app will be available. References to storybook packages are built outside of this app. (ex: `./@asu/unity-bootstrap-theme/index.html`)
