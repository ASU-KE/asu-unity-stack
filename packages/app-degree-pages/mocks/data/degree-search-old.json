They develop adaptive techniques for students with disabilities and learn to use instructional and assistive technologies to facilitate success in the general education curriculum. Since special educators work within collaborative partnerships that promote inclusive practices, these skills are emphasized throughout the professional preparation sequence, with additional training in interpersonal communication and problem-solving skills.</p>The special education and elementary education program is clinically embedded during the junior and senior years. It provides teacher candidates with multiple opportunities to work directly with children and youth to practice what is learned during coursework in authentic settings. During the junior year, teacher candidates intern in classrooms serving students with special needs. The senior year residency is a full-time, two-semester experience. Senior year teacher candidates practice in teams of residents and interns in partner school districts, working across classrooms under the guidance of certified lead teachers.

The primary goal of all professional experiences is to provide students with multiple opportunities to apply knowledge learned in ASU coursework to classroom practice in grades 6-12. Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College students complete internships one day a week during the junior year and first semester of the senior year. In the final semester, students complete a full-time teaching residency. Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College faculty and highly qualified lead teachers from partner school districts and charter schools collaboratively coach interns and residents during required professional experiences. The professional experience provided by the program provides students an opportunity to work directly with youth and make an immediate impact on classroom achievement. Students are also given the opportunity to work collaboratively with fellow interns in content area and interdisciplinary teams. This intensive, hands-on model of teacher preparation creates highly sought-after graduates.</p>Graduates of the program desiring to teach in a public school must pass the appropriate Arizona educator exam to be certified to teach in the state of Arizona.</p>",

The program is enhanced by a focus on oral communication skills that help prepare graduates for the multifaceted, transdisciplinary aspects of careers in forensic science, such as providing articulate expert witness testimony.</p>If a student is interested in pursuing a career as a forensic DNA analyst, nine cumulative hours of coursework in biochemistry, molecular biology and genetics are required, and coursework in population genetics is desirable. Students should note that the addition of these courses to the academic program may mean the student would have more than 120 credit hours. Employers may require documentation for completed coursework, such as an official course syllabus.</p>Forensic science students may apply for and participate in internships sponsored by metropolitan Phoenix area crime labs or other crime labs around the country. Internships are competitive, and the application process takes time. Generally, fall semester internships require application in the spring semester prior, and spring or summer semester internships require application by the start of the preceding fall semester. Internship positions are unpaid and require concurrent enrollment in FOR 484 Internship. Also, students must have a faculty mentor and abide by all internship standards of the school and those of the organization providing the internship. Students may also participate in cutting-edge research with a faculty mentor either as a volunteer in the faculty member's lab or by registering for FOR 499 Individualized Instruction. For more information, students should see an academic advisor.</p>Job applicants and students seeking a volunteer or internship position within a crime lab are required to undergo an extensive background check that includes a polygraph exam, fingerprinting and drug testing.

The Bachelor of Science in Nursing may be earned through several unique pathways.</p>The program offered at ASU@Lake Havasu is pending approval by the Arizona Board of Nursing.</p>Traditional Prelicensure BSN Nursing Program</strong>The traditional prelicensure clinical nursing program is a full-time, upper-division nursing program designed for students who wish to become a registered nurse by completing a Bachelor of Science in nursing. The program has three start dates per year --- in spring, summer and fall and it may be completed in a 16-month year-round schedule or a 24-month academic year schedule. Graduates are eligible to sit for the National Council Licensure Examination to gain licensure as a registered nurse.</p>Students advance into the program in one of two ways: direct admission or the competitive advancement process. Direct admission is offered to incoming first-time freshman who meet specific admission criteria. Students admitted directly must meet continuing eligibility criteria while attending ASU to advance into the upper-division nursing program. Directly admitted nursing students who do not meet continuing eligibility criteria, transfer students or ASU students who are changing majors may apply for advancement to the upper-division nursing program by competing for any remaining spaces. More information can be found at https://nursingandhealth.asu.edu/programs/bsn/traditional</a>.</p>The program offered at ASU@Lake Havasu is pending approval by the AZ Board of Nursing.</p>Accelerated BSN Clinical Nursing Program</strong>The accelerated BSN clinical nursing program is a full-time, 12-month upper-division clinical nursing program designed for students who wish to become a registered nurse by completing a BSN. Selection is competitive and students start the program in the spring semester.</p>Students pursuing advancement to the accelerated BSN clinical nursing program complete prerequisite coursework and apply for advancement to the program. Graduates are eligible to sit for the National Council Licensure Examination to gain licensure as a registered nurse. More information can be found at https://nursingandhealth.asu.edu/programs/bsn/postbaccalaureate</a>.</p>Online RN to BSN Program</strong>The online RN to BSN program is available online to students who have earned an associate degree in nursing and have a current RN license in good standing with the state board of nursing. The RN to BSN program courses are offered online in 7.5-week sessions and can be completed in 14 to 24 months. There are five starts per year: two in the fall, two in the spring and one in the summer. Assignments may include readings, discussions, papers, presentations and practical application activities completed wherever the student resides.</p>Transfer pathway agreements are in place with all community colleges in Arizona, which provide additional benefits to students. The RN to BSN program does not have approval from the boards of nursing in Tennessee, Rhode Island or Washington to be offered to RNs licensed in those states. More information can be found at https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/undergraduate/bachelor-science-nursing-rn-bsn/</a>.</p>Concurrent Enrollment Program</strong>The concurrent enrollment program pathway is available to students enrolling in or already enrolled in any regionally accredited associate degree program in nursing that leads to NCLEX-RN licensure. This program is designed for qualified nursing students who are interested in earning their Bachelor of Science in nursing while simultaneously pursuing their associate degree in nursing. Selected students enroll in the community college program and ASU CEP courses at the same time (concurrently). CEP courses taken at ASU are delivered in an online format. More information can be found at https://nursingandhealth.asu.edu/programs/bsn/cep</a>.</p>Eastern Arizona College Partnership</strong>The ASU and Eastern Arizona College partnership offers a concurrent enrollment program pathway for qualified students pursuing an Associate of Applied Science in nursing from any of the three EAC campuses while simultaneously earning a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from ASU. Courses in this program are delivered in a hybrid format on the Thatcher campus. More information can be found at https://nursingandhealth.asu.edu/admissions/eastern-arizona-college</a>.</p>",

      "DescrlongExtns": "ABOUT THE COLLEGE</strong>Barrett, The Honors College at Arizona State University is a highly regarded model for honors education in the U.S. and abroad. Barrett stands alone in dedicated resources, size and complexity with a presence on four ASU campuses; a multimillion dollar endowment used to support honors students and their projects; and dedicated deans, faculty and staff that include administrative leadership across all four campuses, 45 Faculty Fellows and 64 staff within the college on each campus, and more than 1,900 university faculty members who teach and mentor Barrett students from all majors across all four campuses. Barrett students are members of a close-knit community of scholars with a history of securing national and international scholarships and fellowships that fund research, international study, professional development or post-baccalaureate study, placing ASU among the top schools in the United States for success in national scholarship competitions.</p>With its outstanding programs, dedicated faculty and staff and comprehensive facilities, Barrett is a national model for organizing resources to support the honors experience at all four campuses at ASU. This unique arrangement is a model for higher education and has often been referred to as the best of both worlds by students who thrive in a small college atmosphere but appreciate access to large university programs like Division I athletics and to high profile lecturers.</p>A four-year residential college experience is the hallmark of the Barrett living and learning experience. The Tempe campus has a nine-acre, first-of-its-kind in the nation honors complex with residence halls for 1,700 students, multiple classrooms, a community center, dining hall and refectory and administrative offices. The honors residential experience continues across the street with upper-division housing for 1,600 students in the 18-acre Vista Del Sol Community.</p>The Barrett Honors College residential experience also extends to the Downtown, Polytechnic and West campuses. The Barrett Downtown residential community, called B-Town D-Town, is symbolic of the City Honors identity. Located at Taylor Place, this community is nestled at the heart of the campus and offers a rich, compelling and stunning living environment where students have easy access to ASU's downtown colleges and preprofessional programs as well as the unique and buoyant ambiance of the sports, governmental, and commercial lifestyle of Phoenix, the sixth largest growing city in the nation.</p>Barrett at the Polytechnic campus gives students the feeling of studying at a small private college with the advantages of a large university. Lantana Hall, the brand new residential building for the Polytechnic honors community, offers study and lounge spaces, a courtyard with community grills and an event lawn. Home to the Barrett Suite, Lantana Hall also features classrooms, a computer lab and staff and faculty offices.</p>Barrett at the West campus provides the entire range of honors activities in a small liberal arts college setting on the beautiful ASU West campus. Honors students live in both the Casa de Oro and Las Casas residence halls with approximately 500 other residents and take advantage of the new fitness center and dining hall. The space dedicated solely to Honors students includes the 5,000-square-foot Barrett Suite complete with computer lab, study rooms, and meeting areas, as well as the Barrett West dean, faculty, and staff offices. Students benefit greatly by taking all their honors classes in the specially designed Barrett West seminar room.</p>STUDENT OPPORTUNITIES</strong>ASU's size, number of majors, student organizations and student support services is an advantage and provides important opportunities for Barrett students to engage in meaningful ways. With the largest college residential profile across all four campuses, Barrett significantly contributes to the student life of the university. Barrett students demonstrate leadership in the classroom; in research labs; in mentoring and tutoring other students; and in securing leadership roles in student government, Changemaker Central, Greek Life and more than 800 student organizations. Barrett offers a full range of student-driven academic, service, wellness, arts, cultural, social, entrepreneurial and sustainability programming, through both Barrett student organizations and college-specific programming overall. Barrett students also positively impact ASU and local, national and global communities through internships, service, travel and other professional development opportunities within Barrett and across ASU. Barrett students participate in study abroad programs that enable them to travel to foreign countries, immerse themselves in small classes taught by honors faculty and experience different cultures and societies while earning honors credits.</p>Barrett students engage in cutting-edge research with distinguished ASU faculty or through special partnerships with the Mayo Clinic, the Biodesign Institute and Intel. Students are developing iPhone applications, building robots, designing games or developing tools to improve health care, meet global energy needs and provide clean water or secure data and information privacy. Many students also take advantage of internship opportunities developed exclusively for Barrett students with organizations like Mayo Clinic, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Google, and local congressional districts, the governor's office and the United States Senate.</p>The relatively new T.W. Lewis Center for Personal Development provides innovative courses, workshops and an engaging speaker series designed to help students achieve their personal best both during and after their college experience. The courses offered in the T.W. Lewis Center for Personal Development are HON courses and are open to all Barrett students, regardless of campus, year or major. The interactive workshops are led by industry and academic experts in areas such as: personal development, career success, financial literacy and life skills. The speaker series brings dynamic and inspiring industry and community leaders to give students a chance to hear from them and have community dialogue.</p>",
