Awarded four stars by the prestigious Golf Digest Rating Panel, this well-maintained and challenging design features Dye&rsquo;s signature mounding and creative bunkering &ndash; making proper club selection essential for low scoring. The ASU Karsten Golf Course, opened in 1989, is a tremendous asset to the Tempe community and for the golf program at ASU. The ASU golf teams enjoy premier amenities, including the Golf Performance Center, separate driving ranges, putting greens, plus chipping and sand practice areas reserved specifically for the ASU golf teams.<\/p>\n<p>The Sun Angel Clubhouse at ASU Karsten Golf Course was completed in 1994.The two-story clubhouse consists of a large pro shop, an inside dining area and an expansive outdoor patio overlooking the golf course. The upper level includes a permanent tribute to former ASU golfer Heather Farr, who succumbed to cancer in November 1993, and also features a glassed instructional studio. The player practice and instructional facility serves as the home of the ASU men's and women's golf teams. The building includes \"Hobbs House\", named after Bob and Karen Hobbs and family, who were major contributors to the clubhouse. Inside the facility is a large player facility room that has a state-of the-art video analysis system, a study area and a team meeting room.<\/p>\n<div id=\"moreinfo\">\n<p>For more information:&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/thesundevils.collegesports.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><br \/>Sun Devil Athletics<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/thesundevils.collegesports.com\/sports\/m-golf\/asu-m-golf-body.html\" target=\"_blank\">Men's Golf<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/thesundevils.collegesports.com\/sports\/w-golf\/asu-w-golf-body.html\" target=\"_blank\">Women's Golf<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"building_data\">\n<div class=\"address_code\">\n<h5>Street Address<\/h5>\n<p>1125 E.

When remodeling of the Matthews Library was completed in 1951, the president&rsquo;s and vice president&rsquo;s offices and placement services occupied the lounge area. In 1964, the building became the Lyceum Theater.<\/p>\n<div id=\"moreinfo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"building_data\">\n<div class=\"address_code\">\n<h5>Street Address<\/h5>\n<p>901 S.

Exhibitions may include group shows mounted by  areas of the school, alumni or current student exhibitions, faculty  exhibitions, exhibitions organized in cooperation with campus galleries,  conference organizers or other fine art organizations such as local  collections or other universities and traveling or exchange exhibits  from peer institutions. Exhibition proposals are solicited from the  School of Art community, reviewed, and selected by the school's gallery  and exhibitions committee made of local arts professionals. The gallery  teaching assistant, gallery technician and members of the gallery  exhibitions class administer and provide installation assistance to the  exhibitors.

Depending upon equipment and space needs, graduate students can utilize looms, dye facilities or print tables in the studios as well.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>The Step Gallery serves as both an MFA thesis exhibition space as well  as a proposal-driven and student-run gallery in the ASU Herberger  Institute School of Art. While these MFA exhibits represent one of the  requirements for the fulfillment of the MFA degree under School of Art  and Graduate Education procedures, the proposal-driven exhibitions allow  undergraduates, graduates, alumni, and faculty unique curatorial and  exhibition opportunities. Exhibitions may include group shows mounted by  areas of the school, alumni or current student exhibitions, faculty  exhibitions, exhibitions organized in cooperation with campus galleries,  conference organizers or other fine art organizations such as local  collections or other universities and traveling or exchange exhibits  from peer institutions. Exhibition proposals are solicited from the  School of Art community, reviewed, and selected by the school's gallery  and exhibitions committee made of local arts professionals. The gallery  teaching assistant, gallery technician and members of the gallery  exhibitions class administer and provide installation assistance to the  exhibitors. In recognition of the primary function of the gallery as an  academic and teaching tool of the School of Art, the selection of  exhibitions will inevitably, over time, include content not appreciated  or understood by all viewers and visitors.

Awarded four stars by the prestigious Golf Digest Rating Panel, this well-maintained and challenging design features Dye&rsquo;s signature mounding and creative bunkering &ndash; making proper club selection essential for low scoring. The ASU Karsten Golf Course, opened in 1989, is a tremendous asset to the Tempe community and for the golf program at ASU. The ASU golf teams enjoy premier amenities, including the Golf Performance Center, separate driving ranges, putting greens, plus chipping and sand practice areas reserved specifically for the ASU golf teams.<\/p>\n<p>The Sun Angel Clubhouse at ASU Karsten Golf Course was completed in 1994.The two-story clubhouse consists of a large pro shop, an inside dining area and an expansive outdoor patio overlooking the golf course. The upper level includes a permanent tribute to former ASU golfer Heather Farr, who succumbed to cancer in November 1993, and also features a glassed instructional studio. The player practice and instructional facility serves as the home of the ASU men's and women's golf teams.

This opens up the possibility to use bottom-up biogenic structures wherever \"classic\" top-down manufacturing proves to be too costly, too slow or not sustainable when it comes to resource consumption. The integration can be performed using well-established materials and techniques in micro-machining, making it attractive for industrial manufacturing.  Nanopore membranes are widely used in the biological sciences as filters. While they are commercially available (Nucleopore membranes), they suffer from a limited fluid throughput, since the membrane has to be thick to remain stable and the number of pores has to be limited. Nature has found a way to circumvent this problem by using an intricate hierarchical structure when building a support structure, for example for marine algae. These structures have been studied previously, but until now it was not clear if these biogenic structures can be used as building blocks in microfluidic assemblies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>QESST:  Revolutionizing Energy for the World<\/strong><br \/><strong style=\"color: brown;\">Engineering<\/strong><br \/><em>Saturday, February 28, 2015 - 4:00pm to 9:00pm<br \/>QESST Space:  ERC Building First Floor<\/em><br \/>Come take part in the solar energy revolution and work alongside the scientists and engineers of ASU&rsquo;s Quantum Energy and Sustainable Solar Technologies Engineering Research Center to explore the science behind solar energy!&nbsp; Build your best Lego solar car design and use the power of the sun to race to the finish line.&nbsp; Explore the workings of solar panels as you use them to operate solar powered toys.&nbsp; Get an up close look at solar engineers at work in the QESST solar laboratories.&nbsp; Lab tours will begin at 5:00 p.m.&nbsp; Talk to QESST Scholars and get all your burning solar energy questions answered.  &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Smart Airplanes<\/strong><br \/><strong style=\"color: brown;\">Engineering<\/strong><br \/><em>Saturday, February 28, 2015 - 4:00pm to 9:00pm<br \/>ENGRC 426<\/em><br \/>What if an airplane could detect damage and repair itself like the human body?

By harnessing the power of thousands of computers that are communicating with each other simultaneously, a big problem can be divided and conquered. Sounds simple enough, but coordinating all of these computers requires a special kind of expertise.  Members of the community are invited to come learn more about high performance computing via an interactive tour of the ASU Advanced Computing Center's facilities.

The area gives both students and campus visitors an inviting place to meet, relax and hold pre-game gatherings.<\/p>"}]},{"mapId":"120","catId":"7134","catIid":"7156","parent":"6267","private":"0","lat":"0.000000","lng":"0.000000","level":"0","marker_alt":"0","map_alt":"0","shared":"0","changed":"2015-02-06

(a FREE service) uses small buses to serve residential areas and connect them to local destinations such as shopping areas, other neighborhoods, major bus routes, schools and multi-generational centers. There are five Orbit routes: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and Jupiter.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hours of operation: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every 15 minutes &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span>Saturday from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. every 15 minutes <span>&nbsp;<\/span> <\/span> <br \/> <span>Sunday from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. every 30 minutes <span>&nbsp;<\/span> <\/span> <br \/> <span>Orbit Earth runs every 30 minutes from 7 p.m. until 11 p.m. Monday through Saturday<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Orbit routes use &ldquo;flag&rdquo; stops, which means that the driver will pick up and drop off passengers in residential neighborhoods provided it is safe to do so. Passengers should wave at the driver to let him or her know that they would like picked up. On major streets like Mill Avenue, University Drive and Broadway Road, designated bus stops should be used. The Orbit will only stop at designated bus stops where an \"Orbit\" decal is placed on the blue bus stop signs. This indicates which routes serve a particular stop.
